# Structural Design Patterns

## Adapter:
Converts the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects. It allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.

## Composite:
Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## Proxy:
Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It is used to create a representative object that controls access to a more complex or resource-intensive object.

## Flyweight:
Reduces the cost of creating and managing a large number of similar objects by sharing as much data as possible between them. It is used to minimize memory usage or computational expenses by sharing common parts of object states.

## Facade:
Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use. It offers a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

## Bridge:
Separates an objectâ€™s abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. It is used to decouple an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to evolve separately.

## Decorator:
Adds additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
