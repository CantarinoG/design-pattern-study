# Design Patterns

The Gang of Four (GoF), consisting of Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, defined 23 classic software design patterns in their book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software". These patterns are categorized into three types.

## Creational Patterns: 
### These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable for the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by controlling this object creation. 
* Singleton
* Factory Method
* Abstract Factory
* Builder
* Prototype

## Structural Patterns: 
### These patterns deal with object composition or the structure of classes and objects. They help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to do the same.
* Adapter
* Composite
* Proxy
* Flyweight
* Facade
* Bridge
* Decorator

## Behavioral Patterns: 
### These patterns are concerned with object interaction and responsibility delegation. They help in defining how objects communicate with each other.
* Chain of Responsibility
* Command
* Interpreter
* Iterator
* Mediator
* Memento
* Observer
* State
* Strategy
* Template Method
* Visitor
